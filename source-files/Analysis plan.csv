"Health, Access to basic needs","Life satisfaction
Access to electricity",Is there a relationship between a population's level of access to electricity and their overall satisfaction in life?,Correlation,Scatter plot with trendline,Rsquared score of 0.54,"According to ChatGPT, scores between 0.3 and 0.5 are meaningful. I've read similarly in stats articles/textbooks.

Clearly can't claim causality here but interesting nonetheless, particularly because the rates of access to electricity are high overall."
Access to basic needs,"✅ % of population with access to electricity (2020)

✅ Number of people with access to electricity (2020)

(Could also consider GDP per Capita indirectly, but it’s more economic than needs-based.)","- What % of the population has reliable access to electricity across countries?

Environment,"⚠️ None of the listed indicators directly measure environmental quality (air, water, CO₂ emissions, biodiversity, etc.).

❌ Indicators provided are not suitable here.","- Which countries show the lowest environmental sustainability (e.g., highest CO₂ per capita)?

Equity,"⚠️ None of the listed indicators directly capture inequality (e.g., Gini coefficient, gender parity, minority representation).

❌ No strong match among current indicators.","- What is the level of income inequality in each country?

"""Freedom, Rights, + Governance""","⚠️ Could potentially be proxied through UN Speeches (if content analysis was done on themes of political freedom, human rights, etc.), but nothing here directly measures freedom.

❌ No clear indicator provided.","- How do countries score on measures of political and civil freedoms?
- Is greater freedom associated with higher life satisfaction?
- Are there regions where freedoms are restricted but economic outcomes remain high?
